# Front-End	Developer	Handbook	

Written	by	Cody	Lindley	sponsored	by	—	Frontend	Masters

Introduction


This	is	a	guide	that	anyone	could	use	to	learn	about	the	practice	of	front-end	development.	It
broadly	outlines	and	discusses	the	practice	of	front-end	engineering:	how	to	learn	it	and
what	tools	are	used	when	practicing	it	in	2018.

It	is	specifically	written	with	the	intention	of	being	a	professional	resource	for	potential	and
currently	practicing	front-end	developers	to	equip	themselves	with	learning	materials	and
development	tools.	Secondarily,	it	can	be	used	by	managers,	CTOs,	instructors,	and	head
hunters	to	gain	insights	into	the	practice	of	front-end	development.

The	content	of	the	handbook	favors	web	technologies	(HTML,	CSS,	DOM,	and	JavaScript)
and	those	solutions	that	are	directly	built	on	top	of	these	open	technologies.	The	materials
referenced	and	discussed	in	the	book	are	either	best	in	class	or	the	current	offering	to	a
problem.

The	book	should	not	be	considered	a	comprehensive	outline	of	all	resources	available	to	a
front-end	developer.	The	value	of	the	book	is	tied	up	in	a	terse,	focused,	and	timely	curation
of	just	enough	categorical	information	so	as	not	to	overwhelm	anyone	on	any	one	particular
subject	matter.

The	intention	is	to	release	an	update	to	the	content	yearly.

The	handbook	is	divided	into	the	following	three	parts:

## Part	I.	The	Front-End	Practice

Part	one	broadly	describes	the	practice	of	front-end	engineering.

## Part	II:	Learning	Front-End	Development

Part	two	identifies	self-directed	and	direct	resources	for	learning	to	become	a	front-end
developer.

## Part	III:	Front-End	Development	Tools

Part	three	briefly	explains	and	identifies	tools	of	the	trade.

# What	Is	a	Front-End	Developer?

```
Front-end	web	development,	also	known	as	client-side	development	is	the	practice	of
producing	HTML,	CSS	and	JavaScript	for	a	website	or	Web	Application	so	that	a	user
can	see	and	interact	with	them	directly.	The	challenge	associated	with	front	end
development	is	that	the	tools	and	techniques	used	to	create	the	front	end	of	a	website
change	constantly	and	so	the	developer	needs	to	constantly	be	aware	of	how	the	field
is	developing.
The	objective	of	designing	a	site	is	to	ensure	that	when	the	users	open	up	the	site	they
see	the	information	in	a	format	that	is	easy	to	read	and	relevant.	This	is	further
complicated	by	the	fact	that	users	now	use	a	large	variety	of	devices	with	varying
screen	sizes	and	resolutions	thus	forcing	the	designer	to	take	into	consideration	these
aspects	when	designing	the	site.	They	need	to	ensure	that	their	site	comes	up	correctly
in	different	browsers	(cross-browser),	different	operating	systems	(cross-platform)	and
different	devices	(cross-device),	which	requires	careful	planning	on	the	side	of	the
developer.
```
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development
```
**HTML,	CSS,	&	JavaScript:**

A	front-end	developer	architects	and	develops	websites	and	applications	using	web
technologies	(i.e.,	HTML,	CSS,	DOM,	and	JavaScript),	which	run	on	the	Open	Web	Platform
or	act	as	compilation	input	for	non-web	platform	environments	(i.e.,	React	Native).

_Image	source:	https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/front-end-developer/_

Typically,	a	person	enters	into	the	field	of	front-end	development	by	learning	to	develop
HTML,	CSS,	and	JavaScript	which	commonly	runs	in	web	browser	but	can	also	run	in	a
headless	browser,	WebView,	or	as	compilation	input	for	a	native	runtime	environment.

What	Is	a	Front-End	Developer?


These	four	run	times	scenarios	are	explained	below.

**Web	Browsers	(most	common)**

A	web	browser	is	software	used	to	retrieve,	present,	and	traverse	information	on	the	WWW.
Typically,	browsers	run	on	a	desktop	or	laptop	computer,	tablet,	or	phone,	but	as	of	late	a
browser	can	be	found	on	just	about	anything	(i.e,	on	a	fridge,	in	cars,	etc.).

The	most	common	web	browsers	are	(shown	in	order	of	most	used	first):

```
Chrome
Safari
Internet	Explorer	(Note:	not	Edge,	referring	to	IE	9	to	IE	11)
Firefox
Edge
```
**Headless	Browsers**

Headless	browsers	are	a	web	browser	 **without** 	a	graphical	user	interface	that	can	be
controlled	from	a	command	line	interface	programmatically	for	the	purpose	of	web	page
automation	(e.g.,	functional	testing,	scraping,	unit	testing,	etc.).	Think	of	headless	browsers
as	a	browser	that	you	can	run	from	the	command	line	that	can	retrieve	and	traverse	web
pages.

The	most	common	headless	browsers	are:

```
Headless	Chromium
Zombie
slimerjs
```
**Webviews**

Webviews	are	used	by	a	native	OS,	in	a	native	application,	to	run	web	pages.	Think	of	a
webview	like	an	iframe	or	a	single	tab	from	a	web	browser	that	is	embedded	in	a	native
application	running	on	a	device	(e.g.,	iOS,	android,	windows).

The	most	common	solutions	for	webview	development	are:

```
Cordova	(typically	for	native	phone/tablet	apps)
NW.js	(typically	used	for	desktop	apps)
Electron	(typically	used	for	desktop	apps)
```
**Native	from	Web	Tech**

What	Is	a	Front-End	Developer?


Eventually,	what	is	learned	from	web	browser	development	can	be	used	by	front-end
developers	to	craft	code	for	environments	that	are	not	fueled	by	a	browser	engine.	As	of
late,	development	environments	are	being	dreamed	up	that	use	web	technologies	(e.g.,	CSS
and	JavaScript),	without	web	engines,	to	create	native	applications.

Some	examples	of	these	environments	are:

```
Flutter
React	Native
```
#### NOTES:

Make	sure	you	are	clear	what	exactly	is	meant	by	the	"web	platform".	Read,	"The	Web
platform:	what	it	is"	and	read	the,	"Open	Web	Platform"	Wikipedia	page.	Explore	the	many
technologies	that	make	up	the	web	platform.

What	Is	a	Front-End	Developer?


# Recap	of	Front-end	Development	in	

```
HTML	5.2	is	done.
It	was	a	banner	year	for	Vue.js	in	terms	of	adoption	and	popularity.	No	question	about	it.
The	great	divide	between	a	front-end	HTML	&	CSS	developer	v.s.	front-end	application
developer	is	realized/verbalized.
Being	a	Front-end	JavaScript	developer	who	builds	applications	using	web	technologies
continues	to	get	better	and	worse.
This	year	seemed	fuller	than	most	of	app/framework	solutions	trying	to	contend	with	the
mainstream	JavaScript	app	tools	(i.e.	React,	Angular,	and	Vue	etc...)	Let	me	list	them
for	you.	Moon,	Marko,	Hyperapp,	Quasar	Framework,	POI,	frint,	BunnyJS,	jsblocks,
Sapper,	Stimulus,	Choo,
This	was	the	year	that	jsbin	and	jsfiddle	evolved	to	things	like	StackBliz	and
codeSandbox.	Making	it	dead	simple	to	share	a	working	app.
React	continues	to	be	flattered	by	things	like	preact,	inferno,	nerv,	dva,	and	rax.
Cheatsheets	got	organized	with	devhints.io.
We	figured	out	that	the	correct	pattern	for	an	app	boilerplate/cli	tool	is	something	very
opinionated	like	React	Create	App	with	the	ability	to	escape	from	it	when	needed.
Most	developers	found	that	the	combination	of	a	really	good	code	editor,	eslint,	and	now
prettier	make	writing	code	faster,	easier,	pleasurable.
CSS	Flexbox	and	Grid	gain	browser	support	and	thus	more	developers	are	paying
attention	to	both.
We	get,	a	headless	chrome,	finally.
You	no	longer	need	Less	or	Sass	to	do	amazing	things	with	CSS.
CSS	revolutions/revolts	are	under	way.
JavaScript	object	explorer	tools	have	arrived,	JavaScript	Array	Explorer	and	JavaScript
Object	Explorer.	This	is	a	handy	interface	pattern	for	learning	about	JavaScript	data
types	(e.g.	Objects	and	Arrays)	and	their	methods.
The	Chrome	web	browser	dominates	the	market	and	people	begin	to	fear	the	past
might	be	repeating	itself.
Brave	becomes	the	most	pleasant	and	safest	way	to	browser	the	internet.
PhantomJS	is	no	longer	maintained,	Headless	Chrome	and	Puppeteer	step	in.
Prettier	comes	from	left	field	and	becomes	a	staple	for	development.
A	whole	lot	of	developers	adopt	static	type	checking	for	mostly	subjective	reasons	or
band	wagon	emotions.	Some	sell	out	completely	to	Typescript	and	the	Microsoft	way	of
doing	things	while	others	take	on	a	slower	approach	with	Flow.	One	thing	is	for	sure,
most	developers	don't	need	types,	they	are	simply	complicating	already	complex
problems	and	solutions.	Like	most	things,	most	of	this	trend	is	subjective	dogma	not
```

```
objective	value.
Static	site	generators	&	API	CMS	tools	aka	Headless	CMS's	are	now	on	most
developers	radar.
Web	components	still	lurking	and	wait	for	significant	traction	by	developers	that	might
never	come	to	be.
JavaScript	settled	and	CSS	erupt	and	everyone	will	cry	fatigue	by	this	time	next	year.
A	lot	of	people	stop	doing	CSS	in	CSS	and	move	to	CSS	in	JS	when	building
application	using	component	trees.
Yarn	seems	to	have	filled	a	need,	because	a	lot	of	people	jump	the	npm	ship.	However,
the	real	value	of	Yarn	is	the	fact	that	it	brings	competition	to	NPM.	Making	npm	better.
A	new	video	format	for	Interactive	coding	screencasts	(recording	of	working	in	a	live
editor	that	you	can	edit	too)	becomes	a	real	thing	with	Scrimba.
Most	people	begin	to	see	the	correlation	between	component	architectures	and	atomic
design.
And	so	it	begins	that	ES	modules	will	be	part	of	the	browser	and	if	used	a	backup	plan
will	be	required	(i.e.	a	bundle	from	something	like	webpack).
MVC	frameworks	are	on	the	outs.
Developing	and	displaying	React	components	outside	of	your	applications	is	made
popular	by	tools	like	Bluekit,	Storybook,	React	Styleguidist,	and	bit.
Getting	a	front-end	job	in	2017	is	about	experience,	which	is	displayed	from	personal
projects	and	a	developers	Github	account.
Preloading	resources	(CSS,	JavaScript,	Media	etc..)	from	HTML	documents	arrives.
Cypress	arrives	as	a	complete	testing	solution	and	hopefully	testing	will	get	better	as
end	to	end	testing	becomes	the	focus	for	app	code.
WebAssembly	support	now	shipping	in	all	major	browsers
Webpack	dominates,	and	then	competitors	show	up.
React	16	aka	fiber	is	released.
React	begins	to	rival	jQuery	in	popularity	in	certain	contexts.
React	clearly	is	the	most	used	tool	for	building	UI's	with	state.
Facebook	sheds	its	React	BSD	license	for	the	MIT	license	(same	for	Jest,	Flow,
Immutable.js,	and	GraphQL)
GraphQL	got	hot	in	 2017.
Facebook	continues	to	take	charge	in	the	development	space	with	forthcoming	tools	like
prepack.io.
As	expected	ECMA-262	edition	8	is	released.
React	Router	finally	stabilizes.
All	modern	browsers	pretty	much	now	support	ECMAScript	2015	(aka	ES6).
Async	JavaScript	functions	start	getting	some	serious	attention	and	usage.	Mostly
because	all	modern	browsers	now	support	Async	functions.
Mobile	development,	still too hard.	A	strong	rebellion	advocating	the	web	platform	as	a

```
Recap	of	Front-end	Dev	in	


# In	2018	expect...

```
Nothing	will	change	or	slow	the	usage	or	popularity	of	React	for	many	years	to	come.
GraphQL	will	replace	a	lot	of	REST	API's	this	year.
The	web	will	continue	to	become	more	native-like	with	offline	capabilities	and	seamless
mobile	experiences.
HTML	5.3	is	coming.
Keep	an	eye	on	turbo,	a	blazing	fast	NPM	client.
Expect	to	learn	and	use	CSS	transforms	3d,	CSS	transitions,	CSS	flexbox,	CSS	filters,
CSS	grid
JavaScript	usage	will	continue	to	grow	with	no	slowdown	in	sight.
Still	waiting	on	Web	Assembly	to	peak.	This	will	likely	require	tooling.
Universal/isomorphic	JavaScript	solutions	continue	to	evolve	e.g.	next.js	and	Sapper.
Web	components	still	lurk	and	wait	for	significant	traction	from	developers.
I	believe	the	end	is	in	sight	for	CSS	pre-processors	as	PostCSS,	CSSnext,	and	CSS	in
JS	take	over.
Older	server	centric	application	patterns	show	up	again	but	with	a	new spin.	The
pendulum	could	start	to	swinging	away	from	strick	SPA	applications.	People	will	begin	to
pull	back	on	the	complexity	of	single	page	applications	and	return	to	things	like	pjax	(A
mix	of	SPA	and	Server-side	Rendering.	See	https://stimulusjs.org).
Progressive	Web	Applications	hopefully	will	catch	fire.	If	they	don't,	I	fear	they	never	will.
At	least	not	in	there	current	form.
"Chatbots	created	on	the	basis	of	artificial	intelligence	and	neural	networks	will	continue
to	evolve	helping	to	increase	communication	online.	I	wonder	what	it	will	lead	to,	but	this
is	unconditional	web	development	trends	2018".	Nods.
Vue.js	usage	will	likely	overtake	all	Angular	usage.
AR/AV,	AI,	and	chat	bots	will	continue	to	evolve	and	find	there	sweet	spot.
JavaScript	Symbol	and	Generators	will	likely	go	unnoticed	by	most	front-end
developers.
More	developers	will	divorce	themselves	from	plain	JavaScript	and	try	to marry another.
But,	just	like	in	marital	divorce	one	always	takes	most	of	the	same	problems	with	them
to	the	greener	grass	and	little	actually	changes.	Preferences	and	values	just	get	re-
prioritized	and	history	will	repeat	itself.
Webpack	4	will	happen,	and	be	better,	due	to	competition!
Continued	exploration	for	the	ideal	CSS	solution	for	a	tree	of	UI	components	will	not
cease.
State	management	gets	a	reset	and	people	start	to	simplify.	Hopefully,	this	will	be	the
year	for	solutions	like	mobx	to	shine.

requirements	and	standards.

**Front-End	Dev.	Ops**

When	the	word	"DevOps"	is	included	in	the	job	title,	this	will	denote	that	the	developer	has
extensive	experience	with	software	development	practices	pertaining	to	collaboration,
integration,	deployment,	automation,	and	measurement.

**Front-End	Testing/QA**

When	the	word	"Testing"	or	"QA"	is	included	in	the	job	title,	this	will	denote	that	the
developer	has	extensive	experience	testing	and	managing	software	that	involves	unit
testing,	functional	testing,	user	testing,	and	A/B	testing.

Front-End	Jobs	Titles


If	you	come	across	the	"Full	Stack"	or	the	generic	"Web	Developer"	terms	in	job	titles	these
words	may	be	used	by	an	employer	to	describe	a	role	that	is	responsible	for	all	aspects	of
web/app	development,	i.e.,	both	front-end	(potentially	including	design)	and	back-end.

The	nine	technologies	just	mentioned	are	defined	below	along	with	a	link	to	the	relevant
documentation	and	specification	for	each	technology.

## Hyper	Text	Markup	Language	(aka	HTML)

Common	Web	Tech	Employed


```
HyperText	Markup	Language,	commonly	referred	to	as	HTML,	is	the	standard	markup
language	used	to	create	web	pages.	Web	browsers	can	read	HTML	files	and	render
them	into	visible	or	audible	web	pages.	HTML	describes	the	structure	of	a	website
semantically	along	with	cues	for	presentation,	making	it	a	markup	language,	rather	than
a	programming	language.

HTML	attribute	reference
HTML	element	reference
The	HTML	Syntax	from	the	Living	Standard
```
### Cascading	Style	Sheets	(aka	CSS)

```
Cascading	Style	Sheets	(CSS)	is	a	style	sheet	language	used	for	describing	the	look
and	formatting	of	a	document	written	in	a	markup	language.	Although	most	often	used
to	change	the	style	of	web	pages	and	user	interfaces	written	in	HTML	and	XHTML,	the
language	can	be	applied	to	any	kind	of	XML	document,	including	plain	XML,	SVG	and
XUL.	Along	with	HTML	and	JavaScript,	CSS	is	a	cornerstone	technology	used	by	most
websites	to	create	visually	engaging	webpages,	user	interfaces	for	web	applications,
and	user	interfaces	for	many	mobile	applications.

### Hypertext	Transfer	Protocol	(aka	HTTP)

```
The	Hypertext	Transfer	Protocol	(HTTP)	is	an	application	protocol	for	distributed,
collaborative,	hypermedia	information	systems.	HTTP	is	the	foundation	of	data
communication	for	the	World	Wide	Web.

Common	Web	Tech	Employed


Most	relevant	specifications:

```
Hypertext	Transfer	Protocol	--	HTTP/1.1
HTTP/2
```
### Uniform	Resource	Locators	(aka	URL)

```
A	uniform	resource	locator	(URL)	(also	called	a	web	address)	is	a	reference	to	a
resource	that	specifies	the	location	of	the	resource	on	a	computer	network	and	a
mechanism	for	retrieving	it.	A	URL	is	a	specific	type	of	uniform	resource	identifier	(URI),
although	many	people	use	the	two	terms	interchangeably.	A	URL	implies	the	means	to
access	an	indicated	resource,	which	is	not	true	of	every	URI.	URLs	occur	most
commonly	to	reference	web	pages	(http),	but	are	also	used	for	file	transfer	(ftp),	email
(mailto),	database	access	(JDBC),	and	many	other	applications.

Most	relevant	specifications:

```
Uniform	Resource	Locators	(URL)

### Document	Object	Model	(aka	DOM)

```
The	Document	Object	Model	(DOM)	is	a	cross-platform	and	language-independent
convention	for	representing	and	interacting	with	objects	in	HTML,	XHTML,	and	XML
documents.	The	nodes	of	every	document	are	organized	in	a	tree	structure,	called	the
DOM	tree.	Objects	in	the	DOM	tree	may	be	addressed	and	manipulated	by	using
methods	on	the	objects.	The	public	interface	of	a	DOM	is	specified	in	its	application
programming	interface	(API).

```
### JavaScript	Programming	Language	(aka	ECMAScript	262)

Common	Web	Tech	Employed


```
JavaScript	is	a	high	level,	dynamic,	untyped,	and	interpreted	programming	language.	It
has	been	standardized	in	the	ECMAScript	language	specification.	Alongside	HTML	and
CSS,	it	is	one	of	the	three	essential	technologies	of	World	Wide	Web	content
production;	the	majority	of	websites	employ	it	and	it	is	supported	by	all	modern	web
browsers	without	plug-ins.	JavaScript	is	prototype-based	with	first-class	functions,
making	it	a	multi-paradigm	language,	supporting	object-oriented,	imperative,	and
functional	programming	styles.	It	has	an	API	for	working	with	text,	arrays,	dates	and
regular	expressions,	but	does	not	include	any	I/O,	such	as	networking,	storage	or
graphics	facilities,	relying	for	these	upon	the	host	environment	in	which	it	is	embedded.

### JavaScript	Object	Notation	(aka	JSON)

```
c	It	is	the	primary	data	format	used	for	asynchronous	browser/server	communication
(AJAJ),	largely	replacing	XML	(used	by	AJAX).	Although	originally	derived	from	the
JavaScript	scripting	language,	JSON	is	a	language-independent	data	format.	Code	for
parsing	and	generating	JSON	data	is	readily	available	in	many	programming
languages.	The	JSON	format	was	originally	specified	by	Douglas	Crockford.	It	is
currently	described	by	two	competing	standards,	RFC	7159	and	ECMA-404.	The	ECMA
standard	is	minimal,	describing	only	the	allowed	grammar	syntax,	whereas	the	RFC
also	provides	some	semantic	and	security	considerations.	The	official	Internet	media
type	for	JSON	is	application/json.	The	JSON	filename	extension	is	.json.

```
Accessibility	refers	to	the	design	of	products,	devices,	services,	or	environments	for
people	with	disabilities.	The	concept	of	accessible	design	ensures	both	“direct	access”
(i.e.,	unassisted)	and	"indirect	access"	meaning	compatibility	with	a	person's	assistive
technology	(for	example,	computer	screen	readers).

# Front-End	Developers	Develop	For...

A	front-end	developer	crafts	HTML,	CSS,	and	JS	that	typically	runs	on	the	web	platform	(e.g.
a	web	browser)	delivered	from	one	of	the	following	operating	systems	(aka	OSs):

```
Android
Chromium
iOS
OS	X
Ubuntu	(or	some	flavor	of	Linux)
Windows	Phone
Windows
```
These	operating	systems	typically	run	on	one	or	more	of	the	following	devices:

```
Desktop	computer
Laptop	/	netbook	computer
Mobile	phone
Tablet
TV
Watch
Things	(i.e.,	anything	you	can	imagine,	car,	refrigerator,	lights,	thermostat,	etc.)
```

Generally	speaking,	front-end	technologies	can	run	on	the	aforementioned	operating
systems	and	devices	using	the	following	run	time	web	platform	scenarios:

```
A	web	browser	(examples:	Chrome,	IE,	Safari,	Firefox).
A	headless	browser	(examples:	phantomJS).
A	WebView/browser	tab	(think	iframe)	embedded	within	a	native	application	as	a
runtime	with	bridge	to	native	APIs.	WebView	applications	typically	contain	a	UI
constructed	from	web	technologies.	(i.e.,	HTML,	CSS,	and	JS).	(examples:	Apache
Cordova,	NW.js,	Electron)
A	native	application	built	from	web	tech	that	is	interpreted	at	runtime	with	a	bridge	to
native	APIs.	The	UI	will	make	use	of	native	UI	parts	(e.g.,	iOS	native	controls)	not	web
technologies.	(examples:	NativeScript,	React	Native)
```

# Front-End	on	a	Team

A	front-end	developer	is	typically	only	one	player	on	a	team	that	designs	and	develops	web
sites,	web	applications,	or	native	applications	running	from	web	technologies.

A	bare	bones	development	team	for	building	 **_professional_** 	web	sites	or	software	for	the	web
platform	will	typically,	minimally,	contain	the	following	roles.

```
Visual	Designer	(i.e.,	fonts,	colors,	spacing,	emotion,	visuals	concepts	&	themes)
UI/Interaction	Designer/Information	Architect	(i.e.,	wireframes,	specifying	all	user
interactions	and	UI	functionality,	structuring	information)
Front-End	Developer	(i.e.,	writes	code	that	runs	in	client/on	device)
Back-End	Developer	(i.e.,	writes	code	that	runs	on	server)
```
The	roles	are	ordered	according	to	overlapping	skills.	A	front-end	developer	will	typically
have	a	good	handle	on	UI/Interaction	design	as	well	as	back-end	development.	It	is	not
uncommon	for	team	members	to	fill	more	than	one	role	by	taking	on	the	responsibilities	of
an	over-lapping	role.

It	is	assumed	that	the	team	mentioned	above	is	being	directed	by	a	project	lead	or	some
kind	of	product	owner	(i.e.,	stakeholder,	project	manager,	project	lead,	etc.)

A	larger	web	team	might	include	the	following	roles	not	shown	above:

```
SEO	Strategists
DevOps	Engineers
Code	Quality	Engineers
Performance	Engineers
API	Developers
Database	Administrators
QA	Engineers	/	Testers
```
#### NOTES:

A	small	trend	seems	to	be	occurring	where	a,	"full-stack	developer"	takes	on	the
responsibilities	of	both	a	front-end	and	back-end	developer.

Front-End	on	a	Team


# Generalist/Full-Stack	Myth

_Image	source:	http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html_

The	roles	required	to	design	and	develop	a	web	solution	require	a	deep	skill	set	and	vast
experience	in	the	area	of	visual	design,	UI/interaction	design,	front-end	development,	and
back-end	development.	Any	person	who	can	fill	one	or	more	of	these	4	roles	at	a
professional	level	is	an	extremely	rare	commodity.

Pragmatically,	you	should	seek	to	be,	or	seek	to	hire,	an	expert	in	one	of	these	roles	(i.e.
Visual	Design,	Interaction	Design/IA,	Front-end	Dev,	Back-end	Dev).	Those	who	claim	to
operate	at	an	expert	level	at	one	or	more	of	these	roles	are	exceptionally	rare	and	more	than
likely	mythical.

However,	given	that	JavaScript	has	infiltrated	all	layers	of	a	technology	stack	(e.g.	React,
node.js,	express,	couchDB,	gulp.js	etc...)	finding	a	full-stack	JS	developer	who	can	code	the
front-end	and	back-end	is	becoming	less	mythical.	Typically,	these	full	stack	developers	only
deal	with	JavaScript.	A	developer	who	can	code	the	front-end,	back-end,	API,	and	database
isn't	as	absurd	as	it	once	was	(excluding	visual	design,	interaction	design,	and	CSS).	Still
mythical	in	my	opinion,	but	not	as	uncommon	as	it	once	was.	Thus,	I	wouldn't	recommend	a

Generalist/Full-Stack	Myth


developer	set	out	to	become	a	"full	stack"	developer.	In	rare	situations	it	can	work.	But,	as	a
general	concept	for	building	a	career	as	a	Front-end	Developer,	I'd	focus	on	front-end
technologies.

#### NOTES:

The	term	"Full-Stack"	developer	has	come	to	take	on	several	meanings.	So	many,	that	not
one	meaning	is	clear	when	the	term	is	used.	Just	consider	the	results	from	the	two	surveys
shown	below.	These	results	would	lead	one	to	believe	that	the	majority	of	developers	are
full-stack	developers.	But,	in	my	almost	20	years	of	experience,	this	is	anything	but	the	case.

# How	Front-End	Developers	Are	Made

_Image	source:	https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap_

How	exactly	does	one	become	a	front-end	developer?	Well,	it's	complicated.	Still	today	you
can't	go	to	college	and	expect	to	graduate	with	a	degree	in	front-end	engineering.	And,	I
rarely	hear	of	or	meet	front-end	developers	who	suffered	through	what	is	likely	a	deprecated

How	FDs	Are	Made


computer	science	degree	or	graphic	design	degree	to	end	up	writing	HTML,	CSS,	and
JavaScript	professionally.	From	my	perspective,	most	of	the	people	working	on	the	front-end
today	generally	seem	to	be	self	taught	from	the	ground	up	or	cross	over	into	the	front-end
from	design	or	traditional	computer	science	fields.

If	you	were	to	set	out	today	to	become	a	front-end	developer	I	would	loosely	strive	to	follow
the	process	outlined	below	(Part	two,	"Learning	Front-End	Dev",	dives	into	more	details	on
learning	resources).

1 .	Learn,	roughly,	how	the	web	works.	Make	sure	you	know	the	"what"	and	"where"	of
Domains,	DNS,	URLs,	HTTP,	networks,	browsers,	servers/hosting,	JSON,	data	APIs,
HTML,	CSS,	DOM,	and	JavaScript.	Don't	dive	deep	on	anything,	just	understand	the
parts	and	loosely	how	they	fit	together.	Focus	on	the	high	level	outlines	for	front-end
architectures.	Start	with	simple	web	pages	and	briefly	study	front-end	applications	(aka
SPAs)
2 .	Learn	HTML
3 .	Learn	CSS
4 .	Learn	JavaScript
5 .	Learn	DOM
6 .	Learn	JSON	and	data	APIs
7 .	Learn	the	fundamentals	of	user	interface	design	(i.e.	UI	patterns,	interaction	design,
user	experience	design,	and	usability).
8 .	Learn	CLI/command	line
9 .	Learn	the	practice	of	software	engineering	(i.e.,	Application	design/architecture,
templates,	Git,	testing,	monitoring,	automating,	code	quality,	development
methodologies).
10 .	Get	opinionated	and	customize	your	tool	box	with	whatever	makes	sense	to	your	brain
(e.g.	Webpack,	React,	and	Mobx).
11 .	Learn	Node.js

A	short	word	of	advice	on	learning.	Learn	the	actual	underlying	technologies,	before	learning
abstractions.	Don't	learn	jQuery,	learn	the	DOM.	Don't	learn	SASS,	learn	CSS.	Don't	learn
HAML,	learn	HTML.	Don't	learn	CoffeeScript,	learn	JavaScript.	Don't	learn	Handlebars,	learn
JavaScript	ES6	templates.	Don't	just	use	Bootstrap,	learn	UI	patterns.

Lately	a	lot	of	non-accredited,	expensive,	front-end	code	schools/bootcamps	have	emerged.
These	avenues	of	becoming	a	front-end	developer	are	typically	teacher	directed	courses,
that	follow	a	more	traditional	style	of	learning,	from	an	official	instructor	(i.e.,	syllabus,	test,
quizzes,	projects,	team	projects,	grades,	etc.).	Keep	in	mind,	if	you	are	considering	an
expensive	training	program,	this	is	the	web!	Everything	you	need	to	learn	is	on	the	web	for
the	taking,	costing	little	to	nothing.	However,	if	you	need	someone	to	tell	you	how	to	take	and
learn	what	is	actually	free,	and	hold	you	accountable	for	learning	it,	you	might	consider	an

How	FDs	Are	Made


organized	course.	Otherwise,	I	am	not	aware	of	any	other	profession	that	is	practically	free
for	the	taking	with	an	internet	connection,	a	hundred	dollars	a	month	for	screencasting
memberships,	and	a	burning	desire	for	knowledge.

For	example	if	you	want	to	get	going	today,	consuming	one	or	more	of	the	following	self-
directed	resources	below	can	work:

```

If	you	are	not	a	self	motivated	individual	and	need	a	more	structured	approach	you	should
consider	a	directed	learning	path.

When	getting	your	start,	you	should	fear	most	things	that	conceal	complexity.	Abstractions	in
the	wrong	hands	can	give	the	appearance	of	advanced	skills,	while	all	the	time	hiding	the
fact	that	a	developer	has	an	inferior	understanding	of	the	basics	or	underlying	concepts.

The	remaining	parts	of	this	book	will	point	the	reader	to	potential	resources	that	could	be
used	to	learn	front-end	development	and	the	tools	used	when	practicing	front-end
development.	It	is	assumed	that	on	this	journey	you	are	not	only	learning,	but	also	doing	as
you	learn	and	investigate	tools.	Some	suggest	only	doing	to	learn.	While	others	suggest	only
learning	about	doing.	I	suggest	you	find	a	mix	of	both	that	matches	how	your	brain	works
and	do	that.	But,	for	sure,	it	is	a	mix!	So,	don't	just	read	about	it,	do	it.	Learn,	do.	Learn,	do.
Repeat	indefinitely	because	things	change	fast.	This	is	why	learning	the	fundamentals,	and
not	abstractions,	are	so	important.

# Part	II:	Learning

Part	two	identifies	self-directed	(i.e.,	at	your	own	pace	when	you	want)	and	directed	(i.e.,
formal	class	room	specific	times	and	dates)	resources	for	learning	to	become	a	front-end
developer.

Note	that	just	because	a	learning	resource	is	listed,	or	a	category	of	learning	is	documented,
I	am	not	suggesting	that	a	front-end	developer	learn	everything.	That	would	be	absurd.
Choose	your	own	slice	of	expertise	within	the	profession.	I'm	providing	the	possibilities	of
what	could	be	mastered	in	the	field.

Part	II:	Learning	Front-End	Dev


# Self	Directed	Learning

This	section	focuses	on	free	and	paid	resources	(video	training,	books,	etc.)	that	an
individual	can	use	to	direct	their	own	learning	process	and	career	as	a	front-end	developer.

The	learning	resources	mentioned	(articles,	books,	videos,	screencasts	etc..)	will	include
both	free	and	paid	material.	Paid	material	will	be	indicated	with	[$].

The	author	believes	that	anyone	with	the	right	determination	and	dedication	can	teach
themselves	how	to	be	a	front-end	developer.	All	that	is	required	is	a	computer	connected	to
the	web	and	some	cash	for	books	and	online	video	training.

Below	are	a	few	video	learning	outlets	(tech	focused)	I	generally	recommend	pulling	content

# Learn	Internet/Web

```
The	Internet	is	a	global	system	of	interconnected	computer	networks	that	use	the
Internet	protocol	suite	(TCP/IP)	to	link	several	billion	devices	worldwide.	It	is	a	network
of	networks	that	consists	of	millions	of	private,	public,	academic,	business,	and
government	networks	of	local	to	global	scope,	linked	by	a	broad	array	of	electronic,
wireless,	and	optical	networking	technologies.	The	Internet	carries	an	extensive	range
of	information	resources	and	services,	such	as	the	inter-linked	hypertext	documents
and	applications	of	the	World	Wide	Web	(WWW),	electronic	mail,	telephony,	and	peer-
to-peer	networks	for	file	sharing.

# Learn	Web	Browsers

```
A	web	browser	(commonly	referred	to	as	a	browser)	is	a	software	application	for
retrieving,	presenting,	and	traversing	information	resources	on	the	World	Wide	Web.	An
information	resource	is	identified	by	a	Uniform	Resource	Identifier	(URI/URL)	and	may
be	a	web	page,	image,	video	or	other	piece	of	content.	Hyperlinks	present	in	resources
enable	users	easily	to	navigate	their	browsers	to	related	resources.	Although	browsers
are	primarily	intended	to	use	the	World	Wide	Web,	they	can	also	be	used	to	access
information	provided	by	web	servers	in	private	networks	or	files	in	file	systems.
—	Wikipedia
```
**The	most	commonly	used	browsers	(on	any	device)	are:**

```
1 .	Chrome	(engine:	Blink	+	V8)
2 .	Firefox	(engine:	Gecko	+	SpiderMonkey)
3 .	Internet	Explorer	(engine:	Trident	+	Chakra)
4 .	Safari	(engine:	Webkit	+	SquirrelFish)

**Developing	for	Browsers**

In	the	past,	front-end	developers	spent	a	lot	of	time	making	code	work	in	several	different
browsers.	This	was	once	a	bigger	issue	than	it	is	today.	Today,	abstractions	(e.g.,	jQuery,
React,	Post-CSS,	Babel	etc...)	combined	with	modern	browsers	make	browser	development
fairly	easy.	The	new	challenge	is	not	which	browser	the	user	will	use,	but	on	which	device
they	will	run	the	browser.

**Evergreen	Browsers**

The	latest	versions	of	most	modern	browsers	are	considered	evergreen	browsers.	That	is,	in
theory	they	are	suppose	to	automatically	update	themselves	silently	without	prompting	the
user.	This	move	towards	self	updating	browsers	has	been	in	reaction	to	the	slow	process	of
eliminating	older	browsers	that	do	not	auto-update.

**Picking	a	Browser	**

As	of	today,	most	front-end	developers	use	Chrome	and	"Chrome	Dev	Tools"	to	develop
front-end	code.	However,	the	most	used	modern	browsers	all	offer	a	flavor	of	developer
tools.	Picking	one	to	use	for	development	is	a	subjective	choice.	The	more	important	issue	is
knowing	which	browsers,	on	which	devices,	you	have	to	support	and	then	testing
appropriately.

#### ADVICE:

	I	suggest	using	Chrome	because	the	developer	tools	are	consistently	improving	and	at	this
time	contain	the	most	robust	features.

# Learn	Domain	Name	System	(aka	DNS)

```
The	Domain	Name	System	(DNS)	is	a	hierarchical	distributed	naming	system	for
computers,	services,	or	any	resource	connected	to	the	Internet	or	a	private	network.	It
associates	various	information	with	domain	names	assigned	to	each	of	the	participating
entities.	Most	prominently,	it	translates	domain	names,	which	can	be	easily	memorized
by	humans,	to	the	numerical	IP	addresses	needed	for	the	purpose	of	computer	services
and	devices	worldwide.	The	Domain	Name	System	is	an	essential	component	of	the
functionality	of	most	Internet	services	because	it	is	the	Internet's	primary	directory
service.

A	web	hosting	service	is	a	type	of	Internet	hosting	service	that	allows	individuals	and
organizations	to	make	their	website	accessible	via	the	World	Wide	Web.	Web	hosts	are
companies	that	provide	space	on	a	server	owned	or	leased	for	use	by	clients,	as	well
as	providing	Internet	connectivity,	typically	in	a	data	center.	Web	hosts	can	also	provide
data	center	space	and	connectivity	to	the	Internet	for	other	servers	located	in	their	data
center,	called	colocation,	also	known	as	Housing	in	Latin	America	or	France.

# Learn	User	Interface/Interaction	Design

```
User	Interface	Design 	-	User	interface	design	(UI)	or	user	interface	engineering	is	the
design	of	user	interfaces	for	machines	and	software,	such	as	computers,	home
appliances,	mobile	devices,	and	other	electronic	devices,	with	the	focus	on	maximizing
the	user	experience.	The	goal	of	user	interface	design	is	to	make	the	user's	interaction
as	simple	and	efficient	as	possible,	in	terms	of	accomplishing	user	goals	(user-centered
design).
—	Wikipedia
```
```
Interaction	Design	Pattern 	-	A	design	pattern	is	a	formal	way	of	documenting	a
solution	to	a	common	design	problem.	The	idea	was	introduced	by	the	architect
Christopher	Alexander	for	use	in	urban	planning	and	building	architecture,	and	has
been	adapted	for	various	other	disciplines,	including	teaching	and	pedagogy,
development	organization	and	process,	and	software	architecture	and	design.
—	Wikipedia
```
```
User	Experience	Design 	-	User	Experience	Design	(UXD	or	UED	or	XD)	is	the
process	of	enhancing	user	satisfaction	by	improving	the	usability,	accessibility,	and
pleasure	provided	in	the	interaction	between	the	user	and	the	product.	User	experience
design	encompasses	traditional	human–computer	interaction	(HCI)	design,	and
extends	it	by	addressing	all	aspects	of	a	product	or	service	as	perceived	by	users.
—	Wikipedia
```
```
Human–Computer	Interaction 	-	Human–computer	interaction	(HCI)	researches	the
design	and	use	of	computer	technology,	focusing	particularly	on	the	interfaces	between
people	(users)	and	computers.	Researchers	in	the	field	of	HCI	both	observe	the	ways	in
which	humans	interact	with	computers	and	design	technologies	that	lets	humans
interact	with	computers	in	novel	ways.

# Learn	HTML	&	CSS

```
HTML 	-	HyperText	Markup	Language,	commonly	referred	to	as	HTML,	is	the	standard
markup	language	used	to	create	web	pages.	Web	browsers	can	read	HTML	files	and
render	them	into	visible	or	audible	web	pages.	HTML	describes	the	structure	of	a
website	semantically	along	with	cues	for	presentation,	making	it	a	markup	language,
rather	than	a	programming	language.
—	Wikipedia
```
```
CSS 	-	Cascading	Style	Sheets	(CSS)	is	a	style	sheet	language	used	for	describing	the
look	and	formatting	of	a	document	written	in	a	markup	language.	Although	most	often
used	to	change	the	style	of	web	pages	and	user	interfaces	written	in	HTML	and
XHTML,	the	language	can	be	applied	to	any	kind	of	XML	document,	including	plain
XML,	SVG	and	XUL.	Along	with	HTML	and	JavaScript,	CSS	is	a	cornerstone
technology	used	by	most	websites	to	create	visually	engaging	webpages,	user
interfaces	for	web	applications,	and	user	interfaces	for	many	mobile	applications.

# Learn	Search	Engine	Optimization

```
Search	engine	optimization	(SEO)	is	the	process	of	affecting	the	visibility	of	a	website
or	a	web	page	in	a	search	engine's	unpaid	results	—	often	referred	to	as	"natural,"
"organic,"	or	"earned"	results.	In	general,	the	earlier	(or	higher	ranked	on	the	search
results	page),	and	more	frequently	a	site	appears	in	the	search	results	list,	the	more
visitors	it	will	receive	from	the	search	engine's	users.	SEO	may	target	different	kinds	of
search,	including	image	search,	local	search,	video	search,	academic	search,	news
search	and	industry-specific	vertical	search	engines.

# Learn	JavaScript

```
JavaScript	is	a	high	level,	dynamic,	untyped,	and	interpreted	programming	language.	It
has	been	standardized	in	the	ECMAScript	language	specification.	Alongside	HTML	and
CSS,	it	is	one	of	the	three	essential	technologies	of	World	Wide	Web	content
production;	the	majority	of	websites	employ	it	and	it	is	supported	by	all	modern	web
browsers	without	plug-ins.	JavaScript	is	prototype-based	with	first-class	functions,
making	it	a	multi-paradigm	language,	supporting	object-oriented,	imperative,	and
functional	programming	styles.	It	has	an	API	for	working	with	text,	arrays,	dates	and
regular	expressions,	but	does	not	include	any	I/O,	such	as	networking,	storage	or
graphics	facilities,	relying	for	these	upon	the	host	environment	in	which	it	is	embedded.

# Learn	DOM,	BOM,	&	jQuery

```
DOM 	-	The	Document	Object	Model	(DOM)	is	a	cross-platform	and	language-
independent	convention	for	representing	and	interacting	with	objects	in	HTML,	XHTML,
and	XML	documents.	The	nodes	of	every	document	are	organized	in	a	tree	structure,
called	the	DOM	tree.	Objects	in	the	DOM	tree	may	be	addressed	and	manipulated	by
using	methods	on	the	objects.	The	public	interface	of	a	DOM	is	specified	in	its
application	programming	interface	(API).
—	Wikipedia
```
```
BOM 	-	The	Browser	Object	Model	(BOM)	is	a	browser-specific	convention	referring	to
all	the	objects	exposed	by	the	web	browser.	Unlike	the	Document	Object	Model,	there
is	no	standard	for	implementation	and	no	strict	definition,	so	browser	vendors	are	free
to	implement	the	BOM	in	any	way	they	wish.
—	Wikipedia
```
```
jQuery 	-	jQuery	is	a	cross-platform	JavaScript	library	designed	to	simplify	the	client-
side	scripting	of	HTML.	jQuery	is	the	most	popular	JavaScript	library	in	use	today,	with
installation	on	65%	of	the	top	10	million	highest-trafficked	sites	on	the	Web.	jQuery	is
free,	open-source	software	licensed	under	the	MIT	License.
—	Wikipedia
```
The	ideal	path,	but	certainly	the	most	difficult,	would	be	to	first	learn	JavaScript,	then	the
DOM,	then	jQuery.	However,	do	what	makes	sense	to	your	brain.	Most	front-end	developers
learn	about	JavaScript	and	then	DOM	by	way	of	first	learning	jQuery.	Whatever	path	you
take,	just	make	sure	JavaScript,	the	DOM,	and	jQuery	don't	become	a	black	box.

# Learn	Web	Fonts,	Icons,	&	Images

```
Web	typography	refers	to	the	use	of	fonts	on	the	World	Wide	Web.	When	HTML	was
first	created,	font	faces	and	styles	were	controlled	exclusively	by	the	settings	of	each
Web	browser.	There	was	no	mechanism	for	individual	Web	pages	to	control	font	display
until	Netscape	introduced	the	 <font> 	tag	in	1995,	which	was	then	standardized	in	the
HTML	3.2	specification.	However,	the	font	specified	by	the	tag	had	to	be	installed	on	the
user's	computer	or	a	fallback	font,	such	as	a	browser's	default	sans-serif	or	monospace
font,	would	be	used.	The	first	Cascading	Style	Sheets	specification	was	published	in
1996	and	provided	the	same	capabilities.
The	CSS2	specification	was	released	in	1998	and	attempted	to	improve	the	font
selection	process	by	adding	font	matching,	synthesis	and	download.	These	techniques
did	not	gain	much	use,	and	were	removed	in	the	CSS2.1	specification.	However,
Internet	Explorer	added	support	for	the	font	downloading	feature	in	version	4.0,
released	in	1997.	Font	downloading	was	later	included	in	the	CSS3	fonts	module,	and
has	since	been	implemented	in	Safari	3.1,	Opera	10	and	Mozilla	Firefox	3.5.	This	has
subsequently	increased	interest	in	Web	typography,	as	well	as	the	usage	of	font
downloading.

# Learn	Accessibility

```
Accessibility	refers	to	the	design	of	products,	devices,	services,	or	environments	for
people	with	disabilities.	The	concept	of	accessible	design	ensures	both	“direct	access”
(i.e.,	unassisted)	and	"indirect	access"	meaning	compatibility	with	a	person's	assistive
technology	(for	example,	computer	screen	readers).
Accessibility	can	be	viewed	as	the	"ability	to	access"	and	benefit	from	some	system	or
entity.	The	concept	focuses	on	enabling	access	for	people	with	disabilities,	or	special
needs,	or	enabling	access	through	the	use	of	assistive	technology;	however,	research
and	development	in	accessibility	brings	benefits	to	everyone.
```
```
Accessibility	is	not	to	be	confused	with	usability,	which	is	the	extent	to	which	a	product
(such	as	a	device,	service,	or	environment)	can	be	used	by	specified	users	to	achieve
specified	goals	with	effectiveness,	efficiency	and	satisfaction	in	a	specified	context	of
use.
Accessibility	is	strongly	related	to	universal	design	which	is	the	process	of	creating
products	that	are	usable	by	people	with	the	widest	possible	range	of	abilities,	operating
within	the	widest	possible	range	of	situations.	This	is	about	making	things	accessible	to
all	people	(whether	they	have	a	disability	or	not).

# Learn	Web/Browser	APIs

_Image	source:	http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/_

The	BOM	(Browser	Object	Model)	and	the	DOM	(Document	Object	Model)	are	not	the	only
browser	APIs	that	are	made	available	on	the	web	platform	inside	of	browsers.	Everything
that	is	not	specifically	the	DOM	or	BOM,	but	an	interface	for	programming	the	browser	could
be	considered	a	web	or	browser	API	(tragically	in	the	past	some	of	these	APIs	have	been
called	HTML5	APIs	which	confuses	their	own	specifics/standardize	with	the	actual	HTML5
specification	specifying	the	HTML5	markup	language).	Note	that	web	or	browser	APIs	do
include	device	APIs	(e.g.,	 Navigator.getBattery() )	that	are	available	through	the	browser
on	tablet	and	phones	devices.

You	should	be	aware	of	and	learn,	where	appropriate,	web/browser	APIs.	A	good	tool	to	use
to	familiarize	oneself	with	all	of	these	APIs	would	be	to	investigate	the	HTML5test.com
results	for	the	5	most	current	browsers.

MDN	has	a	great	deal	of	information	about	web/browser	APIs.

# Learn	JSON	(JavaScript	Object	Notation)

```
JSON,	(canonically	pronounced	sometimes	JavaScript	Object	Notation),	is	an	open
standard	format	that	uses	human-readable	text	to	transmit	data	objects	consisting	of
attribute–value	pairs.	It	is	the	primary	data	format	used	for	asynchronous
browser/server	communication	(AJAJ),	largely	replacing	XML	(used	by	AJAX).
Although	originally	derived	from	the	JavaScript	scripting	language,	JSON	is	a	language-
independent	data	format.	Code	for	parsing	and	generating	JSON	data	is	readily
available	in	many	programming	languages.
```
```
The	JSON	format	was	originally	specified	by	Douglas	Crockford.	It	is	currently
described	by	two	competing	standards,	RFC	7159	and	ECMA-404.	The	ECMA
standard	is	minimal,	describing	only	the	allowed	grammar	syntax,	whereas	the	RFC
also	provides	some	semantic	and	security	considerations.	The	official	Internet	media
type	for	JSON	is	application/json.	The	JSON	filename	extension	is	.json.

# Learn	JS	Templates

of	the	view	(i.e.,	the	UI)	from	the	logic	and	model	(i.e.,	the	data	or	JSON).

element,	or	HTML	strings.

#### ADVICE:

# Learn	Static	Site	Generators

# Learn	Progressive	Web	App

```
Unlike	traditional	applications,	progressive	web	apps	are	a	hybrid	of	regular	web	pages
(or	websites)	and	a	mobile	application.	This	new	application	model	attempts	to	combine
features	offered	by	most	modern	browsers	with	the	benefits	of	mobile	experience.
In	2015,	designer	Frances	Berriman	and	Google	Chrome	engineer	Alex	Russell	coined
the	term	"Progressive	Web	Apps"	to	describe	apps	taking	advantage	of	new	features
supported	by	modern	browsers,	including	Service	Workers	and	Web	App	Manifests,
that	let	users	upgrade	web	apps	to	be	first-class	applications	in	their	native	OS.
```
```
According	to	Google	Developers,	these	characteristics	are:
Progressive	-	Work	for	every	user,	regardless	of	browser	choice	because	they’re
built	with	progressive	enhancement	as	a	core	tenet.
Responsive	-	Fit	any	form	factor:	desktop,	mobile,	tablet,	or	forms	yet	to	emerge.
Connectivity	independent	-	Service	workers	allow	work	offline,	or	on	low	quality
networks.
App-like	-	Feel	like	an	app	to	the	user	with	app-style	interactions	and	navigation.
Fresh	-	Always	up-to-date	thanks	to	the	service	worker	update	process.
Safe	-	Served	via	HTTPS	to	prevent	snooping	and	ensure	content	hasn’t	been
tampered	with.
Discoverable	-	Are	identifiable	as	“applications”	thanks	to	W3C	manifests[6]	and
service	worker	registration	scope	allowing	search	engines	to	find	them.
Re-engageable	-	Make	re-engagement	easy	through	features	like	push
notifications.
Installable	-	Allow	users	to	“keep”	apps	they	find	most	useful	on	their	home	screen
without	the	hassle	of	an	app	store.
Linkable	-	Easily	shared	via	a	URL	and	do	not	require	complex	installation.

# Learn	Web	Developer	Tools

```
Web	development	tools	allow	web	developers	to	test	and	debug	their	code.	They	are
different	from	website	builders	and	IDEs	in	that	they	do	not	assist	in	the	direct	creation
of	a	webpage,	rather	they	are	tools	used	for	testing	the	user	facing	interface	of	a
website	or	web	application.
Web	development	tools	come	as	browser	add-ons	or	built	in	features	in	web	browsers.
The	most	popular	web	browsers	today	like,	Google	Chrome,	Firefox,	Opera,	Internet
Explorer,	and	Safari	have	built	in	tools	to	help	web	developers,	and	many	additional
add-ons	can	be	found	in	their	respective	plugin	download	centers.
```
```
Web	development	tools	allow	developers	to	work	with	a	variety	of	web	technologies,
including	HTML,	CSS,	the	DOM,	JavaScript,	and	other	components	that	are	handled	by
the	web	browser.	Due	to	the	increasing	demand	from	web	browsers	to	do	more	popular
web	browsers	have	included	more	features	geared	for	developers.

```
While	most	browsers	come	equipped	with	web	developer	tools,	the	Chrome	developer	tools
are	currently	the	most	talked	about	and	widely	used.

I'd	suggest	learning	and	using	the	Chrome	web	developer	tools,	simply	because	the	best

# Learn	Node.js

```
Node.js	is	an	open-source,	cross-platform	runtime	environment	for	developing	server-
side	web	applications.	Node.js	applications	are	written	in	JavaScript	and	can	be	run
within	the	Node.js	runtime	on	OS	X,	Microsoft	Windows,	Linux,	FreeBSD,	NonStop,
IBM	AIX,	IBM	System	z	and	IBM	i.	Its	work	is	hosted	and	supported	by	the	Node.js
Foundation,	a	collaborative	project	at	Linux	Foundation.
Node.js	provides	an	event-driven	architecture	and	a	non-blocking	I/O	API	designed	to
optimize	an	application's	throughput	and	scalability	for	real-time	web	applications.	It
uses	Google	V8	JavaScript	engine	to	execute	code,	and	a	large	percentage	of	the
basic	modules	are	written	in	JavaScript.	Node.js	contains	a	built-in	library	to	allow
applications	to	act	as	a	web	server	without	software	such	as	Apache	HTTP	Server,
Nginx	or	IIS.

that	automates	the	process	of	installing,	upgrading,	configuring,	and	removing	software
packages	for	a	computer's	operating	system	in	a	consistent	manner.	It	typically
maintains	a	database	of	software	dependencies	and	version	information	to	prevent
software	mismatches	and	missing	prerequisites.

# Learn	Version	Control

```
A	component	of	software	configuration	management,	version	control,	also	known	as
revision	control	or	source	control,	is	the	management	of	changes	to	documents,
computer	programs,	large	web	sites,	and	other	collections	of	information.	Changes	are
usually	identified	by	a	number	or	letter	code,	termed	the	"revision	number,"	"revision
level,"	or	simply	"revision."	For	example,	an	initial	set	of	files	is	"revision	1."	When	the
first	change	is	made,	the	resulting	set	is	"revision	2,"	and	so	on.	Each	revision	is
associated	with	a	timestamp	and	the	person	making	the	change.	Revisions	can	be
compared,	restored,	and	with	some	types	of	files,	merged.

# Learn	Testing

```
Unit	Testing 	-	In	computer	programming,	unit	testing	is	a	software	testing	method	by
which	individual	units	of	source	code,	sets	of	one	or	more	computer	program	modules
together	with	associated	control	data,	usage	procedures,	and	operating	procedures,	are
tested	to	determine	whether	they	are	fit	for	use.	Intuitively,	one	can	view	a	unit	as	the
smallest	testable	part	of	an	application.
—	Wikipedia
```
```
Functional	Testing 	-	Functional	testing	is	a	quality	assurance	(QA)	process	and	a	type
of	black	box	testing	that	bases	its	test	cases	on	the	specifications	of	the	software
component	under	test.	Functions	are	tested	by	feeding	them	input	and	examining	the
output,	and	internal	program	structure	is	rarely	considered	(not	like	in	white-box
testing).	Functional	testing	usually	describes	what	the	system	does.
—	Wikipedia
```
```
Integration	Testing 	-	Integration	testing	(sometimes	called	integration	and	testing,
abbreviated	I&T)	is	the	phase	in	software	testing	in	which	individual	software	modules
are	combined	and	tested	as	a	group.	It	occurs	after	unit	testing	and	before	validation
testing.	Integration	testing	takes	as	its	input	modules	that	have	been	unit	tested,	groups
them	in	larger	aggregates,	applies	tests	defined	in	an	integration	test	plan	to	those
aggregates,	and	delivers	as	its	output	the	integrated	system	ready	for	system	testing.

# Learn	Headless	Browsers

```
A	headless	browser	is	a	web	browser	without	a	graphical	user	interface.
Headless	browsers	provide	automated	control	of	a	web	page	in	an	environment	similar
to	popular	web	browsers,	but	are	executed	via	a	command	line	interface	or	using
network	communication.	They	are	particularly	useful	for	testing	web	pages	as	they	are
able	to	render	and	understand	HTML	the	same	way	a	browser	would,	including	styling
elements	such	as	page	layout,	color,	font	selection	and	execution	of	JavaScript	and
AJAX	which	are	usually	not	available	when	using	other	testing	methods.	Google	stated
in	2009	that	using	a	headless	browser	could	help	their	search	engine	index	content
from	websites	that	use	AJAX.

# Code	Editing	Tools

```
A	source	code	editor	is	a	text	editor	program	designed	specifically	for	editing	source
code	of	computer	programs	by	programmers.	It	may	be	a	standalone	application	or	it
may	be	built	into	an	integrated	development	environment	(IDE)	or	web	browser.	Source
code	editors	are	the	most	fundamental	programming	tool,	as	the	fundamental	job	of
programmers	is	to	write	and	edit	source	code.
—	Wikipedia
```
Front-end	code	can	minimally	be	edited	with	a	simple	text	editing	application	like	Notepad	or
TextEdit.	But,	most	front-end	practitioners	use	a	code	editor	specifically	design	for	editing	a
programming	language.

Code	editors	come	in	all	sorts	of	types	and	size,	so	to	speak.	Selecting	one	is	a	rather
subjective	engagement.	Choose	one,	learn	it	inside	and	out,	then	get	on	to	learning	HTML,
CSS,	DOM,	and	JavaScript.

However,	I	do	strongly	believe,	minimally,	a	code	editor	should	have	the	following	qualities
(by	default	or	by	way	of	plugins):

```
1 .	Good	documentation	on	how	to	use	the	editor
2 .	Report	(i.e.,	hinting/linting/errors)	on	the	code	quality	of	HTML,	CSS,	and	JavaScript.
3 .	Offer	syntax	highlighting	for	HTML,	CSS,	and	JavaScript.
4 .	Offer	code	completion	for	HTML,	CSS,	and	JavaScript.
5 .	Be	customizable	by	way	of	a	plug-in	architecture
6 .	Have	available	a	large	repository	of	third-party/community	plug-ins	that	can	be	used	to
customize	the	editor	to	your	liking
7 .	Be	small,	simple,	and	not	coupled	to	the	code	(i.e.,	not	required	to	edit	the	code)
```
**Code	Editors:	**

Sublime	Text	[$]
WebStorm	[$]
Visual	Studio	Code

**Shareable	&	Runnable	Code	Editors:**

	I	recommending	using	Visual	Studio	Code	because	of	the	quality	of	the	tool	and	the
continuous	improvements	made	to	the	editor	that	likely	won't	stop	or	slow	due	to	the	fact	that
Microsoft	is	behind	the	tool.	It	is	widely	used:

#### ADVICE:

	If	you	are	new	to	front-end/JavaScript	application	development	I'd	start	with	Vue.js.	Then
I'd	work	my	way	to	React.	Then	I'd	look	at	Angular	2+,	Ember,	or	Aurelia.

If	you	are	building	a	simple	website	that	has	minimal	interactions	with	data	(i.e.	mostly	a
static	content	web	site),	you	should	avoid	a	front-end	framework.	A	lot	of	work	can	be	done
with	a	task	runner	like	Gulp	and	jQuery,	while	avoiding	the	unnecessary	complexity	of
learning	and	using	an	app	framework	tool.

Want	something	smaller	than	React,	consider	Preact.	Preact	is	an	attempt	to	recreate	the
core	value	proposition	of	React	(or	similar	libraries	like	Mithril)	using	as	little	code	as
possible,	with	first-class	support	for	ES2015.	Currently	the	library	is	around	3kb	(minified	&
gzipped).

```
#### ADVICE:

	If	you	need	a	basic	set	of	UI	Widgets/Components	start	with	Semantic	UI.	If	you	are
building	something	that	needs	a	grid,	spreadsheet,	or	pivot	grid	you'll	have	to	look	at	Kendo
UI	or	Webix.	Keep	in	mind	that	most	of	these	solutions	still	require	jQuery.
